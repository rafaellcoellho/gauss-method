# Gauss Method 

This program implement the gauss method for solving system of linear equations. This is part of an exercise from numerical analysis class.

```
In linear algebra, Gaussian elimination (also known as row reduction) is an algorithm 
for solving systems of linear equations. It is usually understood as a sequence of 
operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. Using these 
operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular matrix, and in 
fact one that is in row echelon form.
