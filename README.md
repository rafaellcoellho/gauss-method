# Gauss Method 

This program implement the gauss method for solving system of linear equations. This is part of an exercise from numerical analysis class.

```
In linear algebra, Gaussian elimination (also known as row reduction) is an algorithm 
for solving systems of linear equations. It is usually understood as a sequence of 
operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. Using these 
operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an upper triangular matrix, and in 
fact one that is in row echelon form.
```

## How to build and run

Build with make:

```
$ make
```
Run:

```
$ ./gauss-method
```

## Method

Formally, the problem is formulated as follows: solve the system:

	<img alt="eqs" src="./imgs/01.png" width="200px">
</p>

This problem also has a simple matrix representation:

<p align="center">
	<img alt="eqs" src="./imgs/02.png" width="50px">
</p>

Where A is a matrix of size n√óm of coefficients and b is the column vector of size m.

First we create augmented matrix:

<p align="center">
	<img alt="eqs" src="./imgs/04.png" width="200px">
</p>

Use the gaussian elimination to transform in a upper triangular matrix:

	<img alt="eqs" src="./imgs/03.jpg" width="150px">
</p>

And find the solution with backward substitution.
